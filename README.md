-GAME DESCRIPTION-
You are an amateur photographer and have entered a
'scavenger hunt' contest to take pictures of all
officially recognized "7 Wonders of the World"
(New, not Ancient) in the least possible amount of
time. You will begin in Calgary and must fly your
way to various locations around the world to take
the appropriate pictures, and then return back to
Calgary with pictures of all 7 Wonders on your camera.
Each action you take will cost you one 'turn' (a
flight between cities, sight-seeing, taking a picture).
Each city has a limited number of destinations that are
possible. See how quickly you can accomplish the task,
by taking as few 'turns' as possible! Don't be afraid
to take risks, but beware of potential dangers and the
risk of getting injured. Three injuries will put an
end to your epic road trip!
