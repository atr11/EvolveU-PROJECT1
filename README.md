-GAME DESCRIPTION-
World Tour: 7 Wonders. You are an amateur photographer
and want to take pictures of all officially recognized
"7 Wonders of the World" (New, not Ancient). You will
begin in Calgary and must fly your way to various locations
around the world to take the appropriate pictures, and then
return safely back to Calgary. Successful completion of the 
game will depend on whether or not you managed to capture
pictures of all 7 wonders, and your final score is
determined by how many "turns" you took to complete your
journey.
